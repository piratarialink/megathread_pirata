###Required Components
You will need to install some/all of these before downloading any games (legitimate or pirated!) to stop games crashing due to missing software on your computer:

- [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)

- [VisualCppRedist AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases/latest)

- [XNA Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914)

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)

###Important must-have software.

- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - for opening 7z/Rar archives. 

- [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) - for opening Rar archives. Has better compatibility with RAR archives. Use this if you have compatibility issues with RAR files, specially for multipart files.

- [Parsec](https://parsec.app/) - play local multiplayer games from anywhere.

- [Hamachi](https://vpn.net) |  [RadminVPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/) | [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/) - Emulates LAN/Local internet connection, Basically a VPN for lan emulation. 

- [GGNTW - Steam Workshop Downloader](https://ggntw.com/steam) - Do not download games from this site.

- [SteamWorkshop.download](http://steamworkshop.download)

###Useful Browser Extensions:

 - [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)

 - [FastForward](https://fastforward.team/) 

 - [LocalCDN](https://www.localcdn.org/)
 
###VPNs:

Do not use free VPNs for torrenting!
Also, do not ever use any "cracked" vpn you see on any site. They are 100% malware.

- [r/VPN](https://reddit.com/r/VPN)

- [PrivacyGuide's VPN recommendations](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/vpn/)

**Tor is NOT a VPN, it will not protect you when torrenting!**

###Torrent Sites
==You will likely need a VPN to download torrents to avoid receiving Copyright notices from your ISP== - unless, your country does not care about piracy. Read more in the VPN section further in this thread. Torrents are P2P downloads - you download from other people who have downloaded the file. No servers are involved.

For a list of uploaders to stay away from, please check the [Untrusted Uploaders](https://rentry.org/pgames/###untrusted-uploaders) section.

 - [1337x](https://1337x.to) - Please get the games from only the following uploaders for games: (Any names from cs.rin.ru, 0xEMPRESS, anadius, DODI, FitGirl, JohnCena141 (Linux), KaOsKrew, s7on3r, TinyRepacks)

 - [EMPRESS Releases](https://telegra.ph/empress-biography-07-15) - For games cracked by EMPRESS

###Direct Download (DDL) Sites
Direct Downloads are any normal download. You download the file from a server through a web browser. It is significantly safer to download this way and ==you will not need a VPN.== In some cases, you will need a VPN to access blocked filehost sites. It is recommended to use a Download Manager mentioned further down the Mega Thread to help manage your downloads.

!!! note "Note: even if it may seem that a game which may not be so popular is only present in an unsafe site, please consult cs.rin.ru.   These files will be usually clean files. Crack files will be given in the comments of the thread. If not, crack it yourself with the help of the tools listed in the [Tools Section.](https://rentry.org/pgames/#Tools)"

###Unsafe software

- BitTorrent/μTorrent - Has baked in ads, trackers, and even BTC miners loaded with their software. The "safe version" of µTorrent, v2.2.1,  isn't to be trusted aswell due to confirmed security exploits.
- CCleaner - Owned by Avast.
- Avast - Notorious for collecting and selling user data.
- Any cracked VPN! 


###Untrusted sites

!!! note "Note: even if it may seem that a game which may not be so popular is only present in an unsafe site, please consult cs.rin.ru.   These files will be usually clean files. Crack files will be given in the comments of the thread. If not, crack it yourself with the help of the tools listed in the [Tools Section.](https://rentry.org/pgames/#Tools)"

 - **IGG Games / PCGamesTorrents / LoadGames / GamesTorrents - they doxxed mercs213 (owner of GoodOldDownloads), package their own DRM, crypto miners, as well as malware, and exploit you for ad revenue.** 

 - **SteamUnlocked / GOG Unlocked / ROMs Unlocked - slow downloads, malicious link redirects and uploads stolen from IGG Games and nosTEAM.**

 - **TLauncher - contains spyware**

 - **Any site which has been stopped/not owned by their original owners. These include:**

   - Kickass Torrents - Malware Risk.

 - **Any site with a scene group name in the URL - SCENE GROUPS DON'T HAVE SITES! (Examples such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA, etc. They do not have sites. Sites with combination of these names aren't safe either.) **

 - **Any site you find on Google by searching for "free game downloads", "cracked games", etc. Google de-lists piracy websites from its search results, which means that fake and malware-spreading sites will float to the top of the search results. This also applies to searches on YouTube aswell.**
